I built a complete Huffman Compression & Decompression tool in Java from scratch and I want to continue from there.

What I have already implemented:

Frequency Counting

Read files using BufferedInputStream

Count byte frequencies using HashMap<Byte, Integer>

Huffman Tree Construction

HuffNode class with byte data, int freq, left, right

Built tree using PriorityQueue (min-heap by frequency)

Huffman Code Generation

Recursive tree traversal

Left → "0", Right → "1"

Stored in Map<Byte, String>

Bit-level Compression

Implemented BitOutputStream

Buffered bits into bytes using shifts

Padded last byte with zeros

Metadata Storage

Used DataOutputStream

Stored:

number of unique bytes

each byte + its frequency

Compressed File Writing

Re-read input file

Replaced bytes with Huffman codes

Wrote real bits to com.huff

Decompression

Used DataInputStream

Read frequency table

Rebuilt Huffman tree

Implemented BitInputStream (MSB → LSB)

Decoded bits by traversing the tree

Used total frequency count to stop decoding safely

Final Result

r.txt is an exact byte-for-byte copy of the original file

Compression and decompression both work correctly

I want help with next steps, such as:

Refactoring into clean classes

Adding CLI arguments (compress / decompress)

Improving performance or structure

Writing a professional README

Resume-ready explanation

Please continue from this state without re-explaining Huffman basics.
